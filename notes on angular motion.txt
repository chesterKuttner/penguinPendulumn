linear velocity (V) = change in distance/t

angular displacement (rad (radians)) = Af-Ai
angular velocity (w)= rad / time

note: 1 radian is the same length as the raduis of the circle so a larger circle will have a greater linear velocity even if the angular displacement is the same

period (T) = time/1 rotation 
frequency (f) = rotions/time

therefor T= 1/f
and 
because w= rad/T
w= 2πr/T
w=2πrf
and w= 2πr/T


angular acceleration (a) = (wf-wi)/t

centripicul acceleration (Ac) = V^2/r= (wr)^2/r=w^2r

linear momentum P = m*v

angular momentum (L) = r*p
                  l=m(r*Vlin)
Vlin= rw


angular momentum L = Tangent Velocity * radius * mass

Tangentile Velocity = (2*π*r)/T

Tangentile Velocity = angular velocity*r

angular momentum in a closed system is conserved (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWSu6U0Ujs8)

Torque (To) is the Tangentile component of force = 
radius * force * sin(θ) 
(where θ as the angle between the force and the radius)

Net Torque = sum of torques in the system

Inertia of a pendulumn will be = M * r^2   
(note this changes based on the distribution of the mass in relation to the radius)


Ftan= mass * atan



Calculation of change in angular mass based on some of forces acting on it:
Ftan= m* atan
Ftan/m = atan
Ftan/m = (Wf-Wi)/t
t=1
Ftan/m + Wi = Wf

Ftan is actually Ftan(net)
Ftan(net)= r * f1 * sin(θ)+ r * f2 * sin(θ)+...

Wf = Fnet/m+Wi
radf/t = Fnet/m + radi/t
radf=Fnet/m+radi


note the two final calculations are

net torque = radius * force1 * sin(θ1)+ radius * force2 * sin(θ2)+...
and
final radian = net torque / mass + initail radian
