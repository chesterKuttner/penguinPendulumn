linear velocity (V) = change in distance/t

angular displacement (rad (radians)) = Af-Ai
angular velocity (w)= rad / time

note: 1 radian is the same length as the raduis of the circle so a larger circle will have a greater linear velocity even if the angular displacement is the same

period (T) = time/1 rotation 
frequency (f) = rotions/time

therefor T= 1/f
and 
because w= rad/T
w= 2πr/T
w=2πrf
and w= 2πr/T


angular acceleration (a) = (wf-wi)/t

centripicul acceleration (Ac) = V^2/r= (wr)^2/r=w^2r

linear momentum P = m*v

angular momentum (L) = r*p
                  l=m(r*Vlin)
Vlin= rw
