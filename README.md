# Penguin Pendulumn

## Simulation Component

### Goal

To simulate the motion of a pendulumn around a movable point. 

### What I've learnt

How to implement Rotational motion and how it can be affected by external linear forces.  
How to use different units for standard motion variables.  
The value of python objects for complex simulation objects.  

## Neural Network Component

### Goal

To create a neaural network that can balance the pendulmn by moving the pivot point.

### What I've learnt

Not implemented yet.

## Penguins

They're fun looking
